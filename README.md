# Temple Run - Run For Your Life!

The **"Temple Run - Run For Your Life!"** series of books are simple *'Choose Your Own Adventure'* style books, based on the aged mobile game of the same name.  In them, you get to decide what actions the main character takes, from a (very) limited set of choices.  Things like 'To turn left, go to page 32' or 'To attack the demon monkey thing, run to page 82'.

There are no health points to keep track of, and you only have to remember whether or not you've picked up one of 3 special items.

After a few read-throughs with my son, I thought it would be interesting to map out all the possible routes through the story, and here we are.

The `*.yuml-diagram` files can be submitted at http://yuml.me to produce the diagrams.

By my reckoning, the quickest way to die is just 3 decisions away from the start (`9 -> 51 -> 67 -> 64`).  There are 12 different deaths, and 12 different non-death endings, with varying degrees of 'winning'.  The story diverges at the first decision point into 3 separate 'Act 1s', before converging at one particular shared 'decision' point.  It's not really a decision though, as the very first decision you took earlier determines your path.  Notably, there's one path which, after 18-ish decisions, will see you trapped in an infinite loop, much like the game the book is based on.
